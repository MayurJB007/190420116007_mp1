            <h2>MCU for 2021</h2>
            <p>2021 was packed with Marvel Cinematic Universe films, television shows and more. 
            We’re more than a year past the debut of “WandaVision”, which was the MCU’s first Disney+ show and 
            the return to the MCU after the pandemic’s freeze. The show dominated the internet in 2021. 
            Shows like “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” and “Loki” followed soon after, showing us 
            there’s a place for Marvel in streaming. There was even a brief detour into other universes with 
            “What If … ?” We returned to the cinemas with legendary movies like “Black Widow” and 
            “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” And even though “Eternals” and “Hawkeye” might not be 
            living up to all expectations, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” was a sign that Marvel can still win big.</p>

            <h2>WandaVision</h2>
            <p>Marvel’s year really began with “WandaVision,” which captured the heart of the internet in ways that still make waves today. 
            The show focused on Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) living together in the town of WestView, 
            an odd sight for Marvel fans since Vision died in “Avengers: Infinity War”. The episodes created a number of theories and 
            speculation about what was really going on with WestView. Marvel fans and internet sleuths to figure out what was actually 
            happening and how the show’s dots were connected.</p>

            <h2>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</h2>
            <p>Soon after, we were treated to the debut of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” which. brought us back down to Earth. 
            The show — which focuses on Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), who are trying to stop a crime syndicate from 
            creating super soldiers — was a reminder that Marvel isn’t always about magic, mystical elements and multiverses. 
            Sometimes it’s about the problems at home. The show dealt with themes of racial injustice, economic struggle and what it means 
            to be an American, which might have been too on the nose for the state of the world as it is now.</p>

            <h2>Loki</h2>
            <p>Then came “Loki,” a show that reminded us why we love Marvel. An instant internet darling, the show about how the 
            villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is trying to get home to his timeline brought us so mny new areas of the Marvel universe to explore. 
            Aliens, multiverses, timelines, variants — there’s so much. We explored parts of that in “What If…?”</p>

            <h2>Black Widow</h2>
            <p>The film, an origin story about Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), she finds herself alone and forced to confront a 
            dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Romanoff must deal 
            with her history as a spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger.</p>

            <h2>What If...?</h2>
            <p>The series is telling alternate stories for characters like Thor, Hawkeye, Loki and Black Panther, among others. 
            It is inspired by a comic series of the same name. The series flips the script on the Marvel Cinematic Universe and reimagines 
            famous events from the films in unexpected ways. So far, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Paul Rudd, Sebastian Stan, Jeremy 
            Renner, Tom Hiddleston, and the late Chadwick Boseman have reprised their roles from the MCU. The series introduced a new
            character - The Watcher, voiced by Jeffrey Wright.</p>

            <h2>Shang Chi</h2>
            <p>Months later, “Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” made its debut in theaters only, showing us that Marvel Studios 
            planned to release its MCU movies right in theaters. The film, about the fighter Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) was also a sign that 
            new characters can thrive. Shang-Chi is new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and his film captured the hearts of critics and 
            audiences alike. In fact, the film even performed better in the box office than expected, an early sign that the worries over 
            seeing movies had dipped. So not only did audiences fall in love with Shang-Chi as a character and the movie itself, but 
            there was a strong indication that audiences wanted more Marvel. With Disney+ shows chugging along, it was clear Marvel had 
            reached a new high for the year.</p>

            <h2>Eternals</h2>
            <p>But “Eternals” may have brought down that high, and it may, in time, be seen as the low point in Marvel’s year. 
            “Eternals” — which told the story of 11 god-like characters who reunite to save the world — didn’t hit the way many thought 
            it would. There was a lot of hype for this film, much of which was not met by the complicated story, the underdeveloped 
            characters and the confusing point of it all. Maybe down the road, there will be more to explore. But fans immediately began 
            to question Marvel’s longevity after this movie. It didn’t feel like a Marvel film. It raised questions among some Marvel fans 
            if the MCU had reached its last legs.</p>

            <h2>Hawkeye</h2>
            <p>Hawkeye is set one year after the events of Avengers: Endgame during the 2024 Christmas season, and occurs over the course 
            of about a week. Florence Pugh reprises her role as Yelena Belova / Black Widow from Black Widow, along with Linda Cardellini 
            as Barton's wife Laura from previous MCU films. Vincent D'Onofrio also appears as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin, reprising the role 
            from Marvel Television's Netflix series Daredevil. While in New York City post-Blip, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) must work 
            together with the young Kate Bishop to confront enemies from his past time as Ronin in order to get back to his family in 
            time for Christmas.</p>

            <h2>Spider-Man: No Way Home</h2>
            <p>So, Here the most loved film by Marvel Fans. Peter Parker's (Tom Holland) life and reputation are turned upside down following his 
            identity being exposed at the hands of Mysterio. Seeking help from Stephen Strange to try and fix everything, things soon 
            become much more dangerous when the multiverse breaks open, allowing villains from alternate realities who have previously 
            fought versions of Spider-Man to arrive. No Way Home explores the concept of the multiverse and ties the MCU to past Spider-Man 
            film series, with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returning as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 
            trilogy and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films, who were respectively dubbed "Peter-Two" and "Peter-Three", alongside 
            Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint

            a forbidden spell that opens the door to the multiverse, including an alternate version of Strange whose threat to humanity is 
            too great for the combined forces of Strange, Wong (Benedict Wong), and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).
